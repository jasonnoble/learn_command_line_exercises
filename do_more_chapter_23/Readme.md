###  For your last set of exercises I'm going to have you use the help system to look up a set of commands you should research and learn how to use on your own.

    Please fill out the table below
    

| Command  | What the command does                  |
| -------- |:--------------------------------------:|
| xargs    |                                        |
| sudo     |                                        |
| chmod    |                                        |
