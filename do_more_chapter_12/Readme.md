# Chapter 12: View a File (less, more)

## Do More

### Open your text file again and repeatedly copy-paste the text so that it's about 50-100 lines long.

    You can use RubyMine for this task.

### Copy it to your temp directory again so you can look at it.

    Please use markdown formatting listing the command(s) you ran to accomplish this
    
### Now do the exercise again, but this time page through it. On Unix you use the spacebar and w (the letter w) to go down and up. Arrow keys also work. On Windows just hit spacebar to page through.

    Please use markdown formatting listing the command(s) you ran to accomplish this

### Look at some of the empty files you created too.

### The cp command will overwrite files that already exist so be careful copying files around.
